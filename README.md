Long Time Advanced Tech. for Tera Hertz Communications: Sounding, Measuring and Modeling
Beyond 5 Generation communications technologies may first involve the new frequency bands which conduct in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with different distances on both LoS and MPCs.
Tera Hertz with wide band EM waves can bring high resolution with massive MIMO antennas for communications and environment sensing.
Time-Space-Frequency-Code Division Multiple Access will conduct easily.
Channel sounding for channel measurement should be firstly conducted to form a physical model for both simulation and engineering analysis.
A proper model is needed for this EM wave signal transmitting.
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface can be used for beamforming or providing a spatial diversity gain.
Eavesdropping and THz communication security will still a big challenge.
Modulation and channel coding should also be considered.
Channel statistical characteristics and transmitting features should be rerecognized.
